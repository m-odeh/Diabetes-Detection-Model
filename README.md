# Diabetes Detection Model
Using a deep neural network I will be prediction if a patient has diabetes or not, by training the model on a data set of more than 700 patient test result which is: 

-	Glucose
-	Pregnant or not
-	Blood Pressure
-	Skin Thickness
-	Insulin
-	Pedigree function
-	BMI 
-	Age
-	Class (have diabetes or healthy)

And to find the optimal Parameters for the neural network, I used a grid search, to test the parameters and compare performance of each one, resulting in the parameters that gives the best performance and results.
